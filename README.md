### Auto Shading Application

This is an application that automatically shades the background of a sketch that a user interactively draws.
I wrote it for a final project for my Topics in Graphics course.

I started this project from the supplement to [BendFields: Regularized Curvature Fields from Rough Concept Sketches](http://www-sop.inria.fr/reves/Basilic/2015/IBB15/)
by Emmanuel Iarussi, David Bommes, and Adrien Bousseauwhich you can find here:

The project uses Qt and OpenCV (2).

If everything is installed properly, it can be compiled with the Qt Creator application or by running `qmake` followed by `make`.
